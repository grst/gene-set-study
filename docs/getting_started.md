# Getting started with `pygenesig`
## Purpose of this package
Gene signatures are sets of genes derived from gene expression data which identify a certain tissue or cell type. 
With [BioQC](http://accio.gihub.io/BioQC) gene expression studies can be tested for tissue infiltration. 

With this package, the validity of signatures, i.e. whether they correctly identify the respective tissue, can be tested.
