# Getting started with pygenesig

_Pygenesig_ is a python package to create and validate gene signatures.

Gene signatures are sets of genes derived from gene expression data, which identify a certain tissue, cell type,
pathway, etc. This package provides a framework to create and validate such signatures.
The package is easily extensible to add new methods for signature creation and testing.
