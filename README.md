# *pygenesig*, a framework to generate and validate tissue-specific gene signatures. 

Gene signatures are sets of genes derived from gene expression data, which identify a certain tissue, cell type, pathway, etc. This package provides a framework to create and validate such signatures. The package is easily extensible to add new methods for signature creation and testing.

Documentaion is available [here](http://grst.github.io/gene-set-study). 

### Case studies
We applied *pygenesig* to the data from the [GTEx](http://www.gtexportal.org/home/) project. The results are available as jupyter notebooks in the [notebooks](notebooks) folder.
